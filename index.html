        <p>The axolotl is a paedomorphic salamander closely related to the tiger salamander.It is unusual among amphibians in that it reaches adulthood without undergoing metamorphosis. Instead of taking to the land, adults remain aquatic and gilled. The species was originally found in several lakes underlying what is now Mexico City, such as Lake Xochimilco and Lake Chalco.These lakes were drained by Spanish settlers after the conquest of the Aztec Empire, leading to the destruction of much of the axolotlâ€™s natural habitat.</p>
